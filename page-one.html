    <p>Following this, the US-based company had assured the Indian government
     last week that it is in the advanced stages of finalising the appointment
      of chief compliance officer, and that it would submit additional details
       within a week. A Twitter spokesperson on Tuesday said the company continues
        to make every effort to comply with the new guidelines, and is keeping the
         IT Ministry apprised of progress at every step of the process. An interim
          Chief Compliance Officer has been retained and details will be shared with
           the Ministry directly soon, the spokesperson added.</p>

    <p>Twitter has had several faceoffs with the Indian government over the past
     months, including during the farmers'' protest and later when it tagged
     political posts of several leaders of the ruling party BJP as
     "manipulated media", triggering a sharp rebuke from the Centre
     . The last flashpoint was the delay in complying with the IT
      rules that mandate large digital platforms to undertake greater due
      diligence as well as appoint a grievance officer, a nodal officer and a
      chief compliance officer. These personnel have to be residents in India.</p>
